# Changelog

## v1.1.1

* Fixes
  * Return "null" instead of null when no origin matches.

Many thanks to @somlor for the fix!

## v1.1.0

* Enhancements
  * Allow multiple origins. When configuring you can now pass a list for
`origins` (`plug: CORSPlug, origin: ~w(example1.com example2.com)`).
* Fixes
  * `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` now works

Both of these have been brought to you by @jer-k - many thanks!

## v1.0.0

* Fixes
  * Don't override headers. Earlier headers would've been overriden by the
    CORS Plug. Amazing that this hasn't popped up before...

As this makes a backward-incompatible change (no longer overriding headers
this is a new major).

## v0.1.4

* Enhancements
  * Add [`Access-Control-Expose-Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Access-Control-Expose-Headers) (thanks @jaketrent)

## v0.1.3

* Enhancements
  * Add license
  * Improve readme (thanks @leighhalliday, @patricksrobertson)
  * Simplify travis.yml (thanks @lowks)

## v.0.1.2

* Release plug dependency
